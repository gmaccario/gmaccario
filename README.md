### Hi! I am Giuseppe Maccario aka [gmaccario](https://github.com/gmaccario)

#### I'm a Software Developer and I live Amsterdam (NL). 

My web development roots are in pure code: PHP and Python üêç, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL.

What I do:
- I am currently working on Laravel projects
- I work on PHP frameworks since Symfony 1.4 in 2010 
- I write and maintain free WordPress Plugins as side project 
- I built few websites about music and I help the owner in order to maintain them running smoothly
- I currently use Docker üê≥ for dockerizing every web app on which I work on
- I worked around 6 years as C# developer, with everything that goes with it :satisfied:

My professional story as a software developer started in 2005. At that time Javascript was different depending on the browser and no frameworks were available on the market. I gained a lot of experience in large companies working on high traffic websites such as London2012.com and Fifa.com. As a Software Developer in Amsterdam (NL) I worked for media and technology companies. 

Expert in PHP, fluent in C#, confident in Python.
